# FinalTestSeptember22

The program is intended to return words, symbols or numbers as strings if they contain no more than three characters. 
First we expect an input from the user in form of a string where elements should be divided with ",". 
Then we remove all spaces from the input string and split it into an array. 
Finally we make a cycle where we check each element of the array and print it in the console if it has three or less characters.
